# CryptoClustering
Module 19: Unsupervised Learning

## Overview

The Crypto Clustering project aims to group cryptocurrencies based on their characteristics using unsupervised learning techniques, specifically K-means clustering. Additionally, it explores the impact of dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the clustering results.

The essence of this project could be used to analyze features like price changes, market capitalization, or trading volume to find clusters of cryptocurrencies with similar behavior. PCA could then help identify the most important features for clustering, potentially leading to more meaningful groupings.

## Tasks

1. Prepare the data by using StandardScaler() module to normalize the data from csv file then creating a DataFrame.
2. Find the best value for k using the original scaled DataFrame.
3. Cluster cryptocurrencies with K-means using the original scaled DataFrame.
4. Optimize clusters with Principal Component Analysis(PCA).
5. Find the best value for k usin gthe PCA data.
6. Cluster cryptocurrencies with K-means using the PCA data.
7. Visualize an dcompare the above results to determine the impact of using fewer features to cluster the data using K-means.
